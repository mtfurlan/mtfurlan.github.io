I'm a human living on the earth.

Really though, I’m Mark Furland, a Computer Science person, in spite of occasionally masquerading as an ECE. You can also find me at [Github][myGithub], where I’m probably most proud of my dotfiles.

This is a blog to document projects, in order to show me, and everyone else what I did. Primarily me though.
