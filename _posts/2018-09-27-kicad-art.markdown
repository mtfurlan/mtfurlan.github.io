Putting logos on a kicad board isn't terribly hard, just slightly annoying.

Approach for copper/mask taken from [komar's techblog](http://blog.komar.be/making-pcb-artwork-in-kicad/), but I couldn't get the tooling to work.

[svg2mod fork for python3 support](https://github.com/zirafa/svg2mod) turns an svg into a `.kicad_mod` file.

* `pip3 install git+https://github.com/zirafa/svg2mod`

Summary
* Vector image in inkscape.
* Layers `Cu` and `Mask`, and any others listed by svg2mod
* Make the mask a bit bigger than the cu, `Path->Outset` worked for me this time around.
* Set units to mm, resize to proper size. It will translate properly.
* `python2 svg2mod/svg2mod.py -i input.svg -o output --name name -p 1`
* put `i3logoCombined.kicad_mod` into your pcbnew library list thing, import footprint
* Shouldn't have to completely restart kicad when updating the footprint, just open and close library manager.
