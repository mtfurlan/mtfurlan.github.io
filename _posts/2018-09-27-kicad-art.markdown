Putting logos on a kicad board isn't terribly hard, just slightly annoying.

Instructions for old kicad from [komar's techblog](http://blog.komar.be/making-pcb-artwork-in-kicad/)
Useful except that they used the old file format, so I just took the approach and used svg2mod instead.

[svg2mod](https://github.com/mtl/svg2mod) turns an svg into a `.kicad_mod` file.

Edit svg2mod.py so we can run it, also fix the shebang line or just call it with python2

{% highlight diff %}
-import svg2mod.svg as svg
+import svg
{% endhighlight %}


Summary
* take image you want, as vector. In inkscape, have two layers with the thing on it. `Cu` and `Mask`.
* With mask, do this [path offset](https://community.glowforge.com/t/inkscape-tutorial-for-creating-an-offset-path/2893) thing a few times
* now the mask is slightly bigger
* save svg.
* `python2 svg2mod/svg2mod.py -i i3logoCombined.svg -o i3logoCombined`
* put `i3logoCombined.kicad_mod` into your pcbnew library list thing, import footprint
* It's the wrong size.
* Resize it in inkscape, set units to mm, it will translate properly.
* Shouldn't have to completely restart kicad when updating the footprint, just open and close library manager.
