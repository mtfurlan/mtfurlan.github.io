So I was given a Sunbeam T20B that didn't work.
Apparently the vintage shop it came from was very worried that someone was buying a non-functional toaster.

It looked cool, and interstingly, had no lever to push down the bread.

The Sunbeam T20 is a toaster from a different time.

Sunbeam called this line of toasters "Automatic Beyond Belief", and they did so for a reason.
The only control is a single bakelite knob, that controls how done the toast is.
