Notes on scripting in kicad 5.1.5, updated 2020-10-13

<!--excerpt-->
As development towards 6 continues, whatever I can get out of rhe debian repos gets less up to date.
The [official docs](https://docs.kicad-pcb.org/doxygen-python/index.html) are too new for me. and aren't useful.

[These folks](https://mirrors.cqu.edu.cn/kicad/doxygen-python/index.html) have a mirror that is close to correct, at least it has the
[pcbnew.TEXTE_PCB Class Reference](https://mirrors.cqu.edu.cn/kicad/doxygen-python/classpcbnew_1_1TEXTE__PCB.html)


modify text size of text starting with "P":
```
for drw in board.GetDrawings():
    if (drw.GetShownText().startswith("P")):
        drw.SetThickness(150000)
```
